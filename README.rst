Monasca Ceilometer
==================

This project is no longer maintained.

The contents of this repository are still available in the Git
source code management system.  To see the contents of this
repository before it reached its end of life, please check out the
previous commit with "git checkout HEAD^1".

The functionality of Ceilosca is now found in Ceilometer as the Monasca
Publisher option.  This closer integration will make it easier to deploy and
connect Ceilometer to Monasca.  To support older versions and follow OpenStack
deprecation policies, this repository will continue to be maintained, but new
deployments are encouraged to determine if the metrics required are available
directly in Monasca, or use the Monasca Publisher.
